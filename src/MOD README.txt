This mod adds a few low-tech machines. I didn't have time to add more
machines (I didn't even think of this mod idea until about halfway through
Modjam) or to fix all the bugs (or not write them to start with).

And there are a lot of bugs. If everything starts spinning at insane speeds,
exit and re-load the world. Speeds aren't saved because a) no time and b) then
you'd have no way to stop the bug that makes everything spin at insane speeds
sometimes.
Also everything is done client-side and server-side, with minimal syncing, so
desyncs might happen easily.




The first things you need to craft are wooden axles.
Put 6 sticks in a 3x3 crafting grid - three on the left and three on the right.
Like a ladder without the centre stick. This should give you 6 wooden axles.
Make a stack or so of these.

Axles are placeable and are used to connect machines. They work how you'd expect.
Try placing some.

So how do you turn axles?
Craft this pattern:
 W 
WWW
 /
where / is a stick and W's are wooden planks.
This will give you a wooden paddle. Surround a wooden axle with 8 wooden paddles
to make a wooden watermill.

Another important crafting item is the Stone Gear.
These are made by surrounding a wooden axle with four cobblestone blocks -
in a + shape.
